# How to Program Your FULL Universal Remote MX-900 with the Editor Software
 
If you have a FULL Universal Remote MX-900, you can customize it to control your TV, A/V components, cable and satellite boxes with the Editor software. The Editor software is a program that allows you to create and edit labels, macros, timers, and other settings for your remote. You can download the Editor software from [this link](https://archive.org/details/mx-900-editor) [^2^]. However, please note that this software is meant for your own personal use and URC does not provide programming support[^3^]. You will also need a compatible Complete ControlÂ® base station to communicate with your remote[^1^]. In this article, we will show you how to use the Editor software to program your remote.
 
## Step 1: Connect Your Remote to Your Computer
 
To use the Editor software, you will need to connect your remote to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure your remote has fresh batteries and turn it on. Then, launch the Editor software and select your remote model from the drop-down menu. The software will detect your remote and display its current settings on the screen.

## Step 2: Create and Edit Labels
 
One of the features of the FULL Universal Remote MX-900 is that it has a text-based LCD screen that displays custom-programmed labels for six adjacent buttons. You can use the Editor software to create and edit these labels according to your preferences. To do this, click on the "Labels" tab on the left panel of the software. You will see a list of devices that you can assign labels to, such as TV, DVD, Cable, etc. Click on the device that you want to label and then click on the button that you want to edit. A pop-up window will appear where you can type in the label text, choose the font size and style, and adjust the alignment. You can also copy and paste labels from other buttons or devices. When you are done editing the label, click "OK" to save it.
 
## Step 3: Create and Edit Macros
 
A macro is a sequence of commands that can be executed by pressing one button on your remote. For example, you can create a macro that turns on your TV, switches to HDMI input, and starts playing a DVD with one press of a button. To create and edit macros, click on the "Macros" tab on the left panel of the software. You will see a list of devices that you can assign macros to, such as TV, DVD, Cable, etc. Click on the device that you want to create a macro for and then click on the button that you want to assign it to. A pop-up window will appear where you can add commands from a list of available options. You can also adjust the delay time between each command if needed. When you are done creating the macro, click "OK" to save it.
 
## Step 4: Create and Edit Timers
 
A timer is a feature that allows you to schedule commands to be executed at a specific time or after a certain period of time. For example, you can create a timer that turns off your TV after 30 minutes or turns on your stereo at 8 am every day. To create and edit timers, click on the "Timers" tab on the left panel of the software. You will see a list of timers that you can edit or delete. To create a new timer, click on the "New" button at the bottom of the list. A pop-up window will appear where you can name your timer, choose whether it is a one-time or recurring event, set the start time and date, and add commands from a list of available options. When you are done creating the timer, click "OK" to save it.
 
## Step 5: Save and Upload Your Settings
 
After you have finished programming your remote with the Editor software, you need to save and upload your settings to your remote. To do this, click on the "File" menu at the top of the software and select "Save As". Choose a name and location for your settings file and click "Save".
